| **Deployment Strategy**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                   | **Pros**                                                                                                                     | **Cons**                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rolling Deployment**        | Gradually updates instances of the application with new versions one at a time or in small batches.                                               | - Reduces downtime<br>- Easier rollback<br>- Minimal impact on users                                                        | - Longer deployment time<br>- Complexity in managing state consistency across versions                                       |
| **Blue-Green Deployment**     | Two identical environments (blue and green); one runs the current version, and the other runs the new version. Switch traffic from blue to green. | - Zero downtime<br>- Easy rollback<br>- Simplifies testing of the new version                                               | - Requires double the infrastructure<br>- Higher cost                                                                        |
| **Canary Deployment**         | Release the new version to a small subset of users first. Gradually increase the number of users accessing the new version.                       | - Reduces risk<br>- Allows for monitoring and feedback<br>- Easier rollback                                                 | - More complex to implement and manage<br>- Potential for user experience inconsistency                                      |
| **A/B Testing Deployment**    | Similar to canary, but specifically tests two versions (A and B) to see which performs better for certain metrics.                                | - Provides clear metrics on version performance<br>- Can be targeted for specific user segments                             | - Can be complex to set up and analyze<br>- May cause user confusion if not managed well                                     |
| **Shadow Deployment**         | Deploys the new version alongside the old version, but only real user traffic hits the old version. New version processes the traffic in parallel. | - No impact on user experience<br>- Allows for comprehensive testing in a production-like environment                       | - Higher resource usage<br>- Complex to implement and maintain                                                              |
| **Recreate Deployment**       | Shuts down the old version completely before starting the new version.                                                                            | - Simplicity<br>- No version conflicts                                                                                      | - Downtime during deployment<br>- Not suitable for high-availability requirements                                            |
| **Rolling with Pause**        | Similar to rolling deployment but pauses between steps to verify the new version's stability before proceeding.                                   | - Reduces risk compared to standard rolling<br>- Allows for manual verification                                             | - Increased deployment time<br>- Requires more active management during deployment                                           |
| **Feature Flags**             | Use flags to turn features on or off without deploying new code. Allows testing of new features in production.                                    | - High flexibility<br>- Can deploy new code without releasing it to users<br>- Easy to turn off problematic features        | - Can become complex to manage<br>- Requires disciplined flag management<br>- Potential for technical debt if not cleaned up |
| **Immutable Deployment**      | Deploys a new version as a completely new set of instances or containers, and then switches traffic over.                                         | - Ensures consistency<br>- Easy rollback by switching traffic back<br>- No configuration drift                              | - Requires more resources<br>- Potentially longer setup time                                                                 |



| **Use Case**                       | **Best Suited Deployment Strategy**                                                                                       | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                         |
